# Lets-start-this-bish
Hello everyone, I'm Alireza Ardstani 19(M) from Iran(unfortunately)
and I am just starting my front-end developing journey and I will share my basic HTML and CSS works here , feel free to inform me about my mistakes , I'll greatly appreciate it if you did.

For more of a personal description read below.


Honestly I'm not a big fan of coding in general , it feels like I'm trying to explain rocket science to a toddler , you should explain evey single little detail 
with the accuracy of the gods to it , I say this becuse my first ever coding experience was with C++ and robotics so it was NOT a good start however I'm trying 
to get past it and start from the bottom so I started with learning HTML and CSS and stuff alike so that one day I might get back to C++ and maybe even Assembly.

I have worked with Solidworks and Blender before and I know a bit of modeling and map designing.
